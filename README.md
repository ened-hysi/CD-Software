# CD-Software
The main focus of this software was to manage all important steps of a CD-Store business. The software was designed to keep data about all the items in the CD-Store, such as the name of the CD, genre, singer, purchase date, purchase price, etc. 
Simultaneously, it was intended to keep track of the sold items by bill number, their sold quantities, prices, and date.The application had a three-level user system: Cashier, Manager, and Administrator; where each had different views and usage of the software. 
Each of these users had a username and a password to enter the software.

#Cashier:Had the right to check out the tech-items that a customer may need from the CD-Store. This meant that the cashier could create a bill and enter the data of the bought item, such as the title of the CD and its quantity.
If the CD did not exist or was out of stock, it automatically gave an alert.

#Manager:Had the right to supply the CD-Store with the needed items.
The manager could enter in the stock the new genre and/or add CDs of the same genre to the stock of the CD-Store.
They were informed when entering the system if there were few (usually less than 5) items of a category in the CD-Store stock, so they could add them.

#Administrator:Had the right to manage almost everything that the Cashier and Manager did.
Besides them, they had the right to manage the employees (Cashier and Manager), by registering, modifying, and deleting them, including their access to the software.
They could keep data about them such as: name, birthday, phone, email, salary, access level, and other information about them.
The data of the CD-Store was stored in binary and text files and managed appropriately by using the proper Objects.
